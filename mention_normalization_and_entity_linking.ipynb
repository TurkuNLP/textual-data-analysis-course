        "While heuristics can be written for specific cases (e.g. search for \"41\" or \"43\" to disambiguate the Bushes), it is very difficult to write general rules to answer the question _which of these entities does this mention refer to in this context_. As is common for cases where we cannot code a solution to a problem, we can apply machine learning to approximate a solution.\n",
